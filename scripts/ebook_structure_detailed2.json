This then defines the 1 required controlling documents and the competence of the people involved. All persons involved in planning, performing, lifting and maintaining lifting equipment are trained and assessed as Principle competent for their role. Competence is assured through 2 relevant experience, initial and refresher training, and periodic assessments. One person in the lift crew is designated as the Person In Charge of the lifting operation. All personnel involved in the Principle lifting operation have their individual responsibilities clearly 3 defined and communicated prior to commencement of the lifting operation. A risk assessment is required for every lift, regardless of category. A lift plan is required for every lift, with the level of detail required defined by the category of lift. A Permit to Work may also be required subject to lift complexity and Principle company policy. 4 NOTE: Category 1 lifts may be addressed through a generic lift plan, while Category 2 and 3 lifts require a specific lift plan. All Category 3 lifts require a Permit To Work. An approved competent person (Lifting Technical Authority, Principle Advisor, Engineer or Subject Matter Expert) is engaged in 5 assuring that all lifting operations are correctly planned and managed. 8 Lifting and hoisting recommended practice A Red Zone is established. All non-authorised personnel are Principle restricted from entering the Red Zone1, and all personnel are 6 kept clear of suspended/travelling loads and lifting equipment or between the load and any heavy immovable object. Lifting Equipment is thoroughly examined on a regular basis by an inspector who is sufficiently independent2 from the on-site lifting crew, and who may be external or an in-house appointee. The examination refers to an acknowledged Standard for scope, methodology and acceptance/rejection Principle criteria. All safety and monitoring devices installed on lifting 7 equipment are operational and not by-passed or disabled. NOTE: Periods of inspections can be influenced by the nature and robustness of use and application as well as the environments of use. All lifting equipment is visually inspected by a competent person before and after use. Equipment integrity is Principle maintained and faulty equipment is removed from serviced 8 and tagged as such. Inspection and maintenance activities are recorded in an equipment register. Principle Periodic audits and inspections are conducted by an 9 Approved Competent Person. Any Lifting of personnel is classified to the category requiring the highest level of controls (IOGP Category 3) and a rescue Principle plan is included as part of the Lift Plan. Any equipment used 10 for lifting personnel is certified for the specific activity and used according to recognised international standards. 1 Red Zones, sometimes also known as Exclusion Zones or No-Go Zones, are areas where access is controlled and no one can enter unless authorized to do so. They should be clearly marked, ideally with physical barriers, so that a person cannot accidently enter one. 2 A sufficiently independent inspector is someone not influenced or controlled in any way by the company or organization executing or responsible for the task. 9 Lifting and hoisting recommended practice AND",

            "content": "To ensure adequate planning and safe execution of lifting operations, all lifting operations need to be categorised according to their degree of complexity and associated risks. This section provides a lift categorization example to help organizations apply Lifting Principle 1. All lifting operations are categorised by the Person Principle in Charge to reflect the risk of the lift. This then 1 defines the required controlling documents and the competence of the people involved. Different naming conventions for categorizing are used globally. This document categorizes lifts as a category 1, 2, or 3 lift. If your organization or partners use a different nomenclature, ensure that the controls are appropriate for the complexity and risk of any lift being performed. Some organizations use more or less than three categories; what is most important is that the categorization leads to the definition of controls appropriate for the complexity and risk of the lift being performed. Table 2 provides an example of a simple methodology for categorizing a lift, alternatives may include: • Critical, non-critical • Routine, non-routine simple, non-routine complex • Simple, complicated, critical, complicated/critical Table 2: Example methodology for categorizing a lift Companies can modify the specific criteria listed to reflect their operations and equipment. Answer the questions starting at the top and not jumping any. Your lift category matches the category of the first question you answer ‘yes’ to. CATEGORY 3 Y N Is the gross load weight over 90% of the certified load radius curve of the crane? Does the operation involve the lifting or lowering of personnel? Will the lift involve tandem lifting using powered lifting appliances? Could the lift be affected by any proximity hazards, i.e., restricted area, power line, confined space etc. Will the load be lifted over or in close proximity to live plant? Will the lift take more than one shift to complete? Will the lift plan require technical input or calculations from a technical expert (i.e., load distribution in rigging and appliances)? Will the load be transferred from one powered lifting appliance to another? Will the load be lifted from one marine vessel to another? 10 Lifting and hoisting recommended practice During the lift, will the crane operator’s visibility of the load be restricted/limited (i.e., ‘blind lift’)? Is the load to be rotated, up-ended/up-righted (roll-up, tailing or special lifting operations) or transferred from one appliance to another during operation? Will the lift be subsea? Will the lift involve proof load testing of appliances or lifting equipment? If you’ve answered YES to ANY of the above, the lift is CATEGORY 3. If you’ve answered NO to ALL of the above, check the next set of questions CATEGORY 2 Y N Is the gross load weight over 80% of the certified load radius curve of a mobile crane? Is the lift outside normal operating conditions for the equipment or the asset? Is the weight distribution uneven, or does it have the potential to shift? Will environmental conditions place restrictions on lifting operations? Is the load of an unusual shape? Is the weight of the load estimated (i.e., not known)? Does the load have any hazards such as sharp edges? Is the load subject to permanent deformation? Absence of designed and tested lifting points? Does the load have excessive dimension (limited clearance from crane structures, surroundings)? Is the operation taking place during SIMOPS or interfering with other concurrent activities? If you’ve answered YES to any of the above, the Lift is CATEGORY 2. If you’ve answered NO to ALL of the above, the lift is likely Category 1. CATEGORY 1 Y N Are all these three conditions present? specific role AND",

However, the number of people required in a lifting crew will vary with the complexity and scale of lifting operations performed. For example, a routine lift involving a mobile or pedestal crane would normally involve a three-person lifting crew, a routine lifting operation in a factory or warehouse environment using an overhead gantry crane may be safe to conduct with a lifting crew of people. The size of the crew must be determined as a result of a detailed risk assessment. IOGP Category 3 lifts would normally require a larger crew to conduct operations safely. Job titles change frequently around the world and depending on the type of site or operation. Table 5 shows examples of this to help illustrate who performs these roles. It is the competence of any individual that matters when deciding if they can perform a certain role, not their job title. IOGP recommends that companies develop a lifting roles and associated competence matrix, an example is given in Appendix C. 13 Lifting and hoisting recommended practice Table 5: Lifting crew roles and example of job titles associated with the role Role Example of job titles Person In Charge Crane supervisor, site supervisor, lifting supervisor Appliance operator Equipment operator, powered lift appliance operator, crane operator Slinger/Rigger Roustabout, roughneck Banksman Signaller, roustabout, roughneck Site lifting competent person Deck foreman, deck pusher Approved Competent Person Lifting engineer, lifting authority, lifting SME",

            "content": "This section describes how to plan a lift and provides guidance to complement the lifting principles related to Lift Plan (Principles 4 and 5). A risk assessment is required for every lift, regardless of category. A lift plan is required for every lift, with the level of detail required defined by the category of lift. A Permit to Work may also be required subject to Principle lift complexity and company policy. 4 NOTE: Category 1 lifts may be addressed through a generic lift plan, while Category 2 and 3 lifts require a specific lift plan. All Category 3 lifts require a Permit To Work. An approved competent person (Lifting Technical Principle Authority, Advisor, Engineer or Subject Matter 5 Expert) is engaged in assuring that all lifting operations are correctly planned and managed. When planning the lift, perform a hazard identification and a risk assessment to determine the lift method, equipment to use, and the number and competence of personnel required. As per Principle 4, the detail required in the Lift Plan is related to the complexity of the lift and associated risk: • Category 1 lifts may only require a generic Lift Plan supported by an onsite risk assessment and team briefing. Generic lift plans may be appropriate for multiple occurrences of similar routine lifts within specified limits but must be formally reviewed and re-issued periodically. • Category 2 lift plans are specific to the lift and include technical details and drawings • Category 3 lift plans are specific to the lift, include technical details and drawings, and may also require additional engineering input (e.g., Site Factors and Load Factors) to define load integrity and stability The technical competence of the reviewer of a Lift Plan is determined by the complexity of the lift. Plans for IOGP Category 2 and 3 lifts are reviewed by an Approved Competent Person (Lifting Technical Authority or Subject Matter Expert). Any change to a prepared lift plan is considered and adequately reassessed through a Management of Change/deviation process and modifications approved by a person with the same, or higher, competence level as for the original lift plan. 18 Lifting and hoisting recommended practice All lift plans includes the following: • Lift category • The type and number of personnel required, their specific roles and competences, and how they will be briefed • The nature, the weight, and the Centre of Gravity (CoG) position of the load and lifting points specifications • Pick up and set down points, and constraints such as space and stacking • Application of the correct rigging methods and lifting appliance positioning • Equipment required and certification checks • Requirements to erect/dismantle the Lifting equipment • Step-by-step instructions • Communication methods to be used • Responsibility for pre-lift visual inspection of the lifting equipment and load, including checks for dropped objects • Emergency and rescue plans • Restrictions on the lift such as weather, light, sea state, ground bearing pressure. • Access and egress for slinging and unslinging the load • Simultaneous, conflicting, or nearby operations or work • Whether Permit to Work procedures are applicable • Load integrity check • Load charts for generic lift plans and for heavy or complex lifts • Establishing a Red Zone and identified line of fire hazards In addition, Category 2 and 3 lift plans may also include: • A drawing or sketch with lateral view and top view. Category 3 lifts may also require additional supporting detailed drawings (e.g., 2D or 3D computed aided drawings for complex lifting operations) including crane(s) and load position, operational steps (phases). • Rigging arrangement including a rigging table detailing all lifting accessories (ID, description, type, quantities, expected loads, unity checks and safety factor based on rigging calculation for the worst-case scenario). • IOGP recommends that organizations performing mechanical handling operations carry out risk-based analysis to highlight the type and level of required/additional engineering analysis, technical evaluation or control measures that would be required. The output of such an exercise could, for example, include the need for determining ground bearing capacity, soil analysis, geotechnical study, engineering design, load stability calculations, swept path analysis, sea and weather state or dynamic amplification factors. 19 Lifting and hoisting recommended practice",

All lifting equipment should be thoroughly examined: • Before using a lifting appliance for the first time • If an installed lifting appliances has been assembled on site, it must be examined by an external technical authority (or equivalent – e.g., a certifying authority) to establish the assembly was correct and it is safe to operate. • After events that may have resulted in damage to the appliance or change of significant components • At regular intervals and in accordance with a written scheme of examination that has been drawn up by a competent person: – No longer than 12 months for lifting appliances and equipment (including certified lifting points integral to loads), or more often if required by legislation or actual use – No longer than 12 months for lifting accessories, or more often if required by legislation or actual use • No longer than 6 months for equipment used in personnel lifting 4 Implementing organizations can define level of use and associated inspection time intervals, for example: • Normal service – 6 months • Severe service – Monthly to quarterly • Special service – as recommended by a qualified person. 26 Lifting and hoisting recommended practice • Equipment with serious and significant notified defects must be immediately taken out of service until the defect has been put right. – If a lifting appliance is de-rated by a certifying authority, it must then only be operated within its new rated capacity. • Equipment with defects that need to be rectified within a certain timescale is not to be used until repaired and recertified, or replaced. This must happen within the specified timescale. For the purposes of a thorough examination, the competent person: • should have enough appropriate practical and theoretical knowledge and experience of the lifting equipment so that they can detect defects or weaknesses, and assess how important they are in relation to the safety and continued use of the equipment • should not be the same person who performs routine maintenance as they would be responsible for assessing their own work • should be sufficiently independent and impartial to make objective decisions • May be employed by a separate company, or selected by an employer from members of their own staff • See also Example Competence Matrix in Appendix C",

            "content": "Further Reading Glossary Appendix A: Lifting Operations Risk Management Appendix B: Example roles and competence matrix 5 Lifting and hoisting recommended practice Introduction In 2006, IOGP published a Recommended Practice for lifting and hoisting operations. Fatal and serious accidents continued to occur in lifting and hoisting operations, and it is clear that more effort is required to eliminate accidents from this activity. The first phase of this renewed effort was to revise the existing document to consider the required competence of people involved in all phases of lift planning and execution, new technologies, new processes, and feedback that IOGP had received from its Member Companies. This recommended practice applies equally to onshore and offshore lifting and hoisting operations, including associated transport and handling. This Report’s recommendations are relevant throughout the entire lifecycle of an oil and gas operation, and can be applied to all offshore and onshore mechanical lifting and hoisting activities in the exploration and production industry, with the exception of: • Drilling crown block, travelling block, and top drive operations • Goods and personnel elevators • Ship anchor handling, marine towing, and routine ship operations not directly associated with Upstream activities (e.g., ship maintenance) • Tree cutting and associated movement of lumber • Mining and earth moving • Helicopter lifting operations • Fall protection and rope access equipment • Manual handling • Jacking • Diving operations • Vehicle maintenance lifts • Piling machines IOGP strongly recommends that all companies conducting lifting activities have a management system that includes specific procedures based on a full assessment of the risks and control measures required. Further guidance on the development and implementation of such systems can be found in IOGP Report 510 - Operating Management System Framework. IOGP recommends that organizations performing marine lifting operations refer to the International Marine Contractors Association (IMCA) Guidelines for Lifting Operations as well. This IMCA guideline provides detailed technical and health and safety information on all matters pertaining to marine and subsea lifting and hoisting operations, much of which can equally be applied in other situations.

Printed Name & Role Signature Date Start-Work Verifier Figure 2: Mechanical Lifting Start-Work Check 7 Lifting and hoisting recommended practice Understanding human factors and improving the working environment, behaviour, and culture are fundamental to achieving safe and efficient lifting operations. This section provides basic guidance on key human factors aspects to consider for those who plan and lead lifting operations. When scheduling and resourcing a job: • Ensure there are enough people to manage the lifting operation safely • Ensure the team members are competent to fulfil their specific roles and responsibilities • Ensure all required equipment is available and certified as safe for use • Schedule the work to maximise operating in daylight hours, avoid working in the hours of darkness when possible • Schedule the work to take account of any adverse weather and visibility issues • Conduct a pre-start safety meeting (toolbox talk), take the time to review both the risk assessment for the tasks and the lift plan. • Highlight any differences observed between the risk assessment and the lift plan and the current status observed pre-start and where required update the risk assessment and the lift plan accordingly. • Review each of the differences in turn and identify actions to reduce risk • If it is not possible to reduce the risk, then the PIC should escalate to senior management and consider postponing the job • Run through the sequence of work and make sure everyone involved fully understands how the job will be conducted Reinforce, practice and thank people for stopping the job: • During the pre-start safety meeting: – Provide them with the Start-Work Check for Mechanical Lifting – the Check is a tool the lifting crew can use to confirm the controls/safeguards designed to prevent fatalities and serious injuries during lifting operations , the crew should go through the Check not during the meeting, but only once they are at the work site and ready to start the operation. – repeat clearly the need for everyone involved to remain alert at all times and to stop the job if they consider that there may be an unsafe act or condition – remind the team of the Life-Saving Rule for Safe Mechanical Lifting and Work Authorization • Lead by example and use opportunities to stop the job, so that other team members can witness first-hand the importance and positive message/environment • Regardless of the outcome of a ‘stop the job’ intervention, publicly thank the individual and back it up later in a safety meeting 28 Lifting and hoisting recommended practice Fatigue and monotony • Schedule complex lifting operations during the first half of a shift, as the team will be less tired and more focused • For lifting operations that are conducted over a longer duration, monitor the condition and attitude of the team, look for signs of fatigue and, if necessary, call a time out to give everyone a rest and time to refocus • People are more likely to be fatigued: – Towards the end, or after, a long shift – If working in extreme heat/cold, especially for after long periods – If starting work after a long journey – If they have recently changed shifts – from day to night and vice versa – On first days back on shift after days off – When performing repetitive and monotonous tasks • Where work has become repetitive or monotonous, look for signs and symptoms of boredom or a lack of concentration. Build in breaks, rotate job tasks if safe to do so, and take time to reset and refocus the team. • Conduct regular worksite visits with a team comprising of the Approved Competent Person, HSE Representatives from operator and contractor(s) focused solely on lifting and hoisting and mobile heavy equipment operations, with the intent to give recognition for implementation of good practices and adherence to procedures, record and communicate observations regarding improvement opportunities. 29 Lifting and hoisting recommended practice Further Reading These organizations produce standards and other lifting guidance: • American Petroleum Institute (API): https://www.apiwebstore.org/ • ASME B30 (Cranes and Related Equipment-Cableways, Derricks, Hoists, Hooks, Jacks, and Slings) • Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (APPEA): https://www.appea.com.au/news-media/?publications • British Standards: https://shop.bsigroup.com/ • Bridon-Bekaert, The Ropes Group: https://www.bridon-bekaert.com/en-gb • DNV GL: https://www.dnvgl.com/rules-standards • Energy Institute: https://publishing.energyinst.org/ • Energy Safety Canada: http://www.energysafetycanada.com/resources/resourceslist/ resources-list.cfm • International Association of Drilling Contractors (IADC): https://store.iadc.org/ • International Marine Contractors Association (IMCA): https://www.imca-int.com/core/lifting-rigging/publications • International Organization for Standardization (ISO): https://www.iso.org/store.html • Lifting Equipment Engineers Association: https://leeaint.com/leea-library • United States National Commission for the Certification of Crane Operators (NCCCO) • Norwegian Oil & Gas: https://www.norskoljeoggass.no/en • North Sea Lifting (NSL): https://nsl.ascoworld.com/reports-and-publications • United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration: Home | Occupational Safety and Health Administration (osha.gov) guidance such as: US OSHA 29 CFR 1926.753 (Construction Standard) and US OSHA 29 CFR 1910.178 (Powered Industrial Trucks) • Offshore Mechanical Handling Equipment Committee - https://www.omhec.com/guidance-documents • OEUK: https://oilandgasuk.co.uk/publications/ • Standards Norway (NORSOK): https://www.standard.no/en/webshop/ • Step Change in Safety - https://www.stepchangeinsafety.net/ • United Kingdom Maritime and Coastguard Agency: https://www.gov.uk/government/organizations/maritime-and-coastguard-agency • United Kingdom Health and Safety Executive: https://www.hse.gov.uk/guidance/index.htm • United Kingdom Chamber of Shipping: https://www.ukchamberofshipping.com/library/ 30 Lifting and hoisting recommended practice Glossary Term Definition Banksman Title or role used to describe a person who directs crane operations.

The Approved Competent Person must be engaged in the process of developing a detailed lift plan that contains: • Crane positioning • Rigging arrangement for each crane • Lift sequence and applicable steps including load distribution • Load movement (the longest radius of each crane for the complete operation must be measured exactly) • Weight and clearance of obstructions • Load distribution and variation between appliances, as applicable • Clearance between load and crane boom environmental considerations, particularly with regards to large windscreen surface • For tandem lifts where the unity check (ratio between weight of the load – including accessories – and SWL at a given radius) of one (1) of more appliances exceed 75%, a calculation justification is to be provided, including additional extra allowances as required (an example is given in Figure 6). Figure 5: Example schematic for a tandem lift 33 Lifting and hoisting recommended practice Figure 6: Calculating tandem lifts A. 2 Tag lines Tag lines are only used in normal operating conditions to adjust the position of a load that is stable and under full control of the crane or powered equipment operator. Tag lines must be free of knots and fraying. Tag lines can introduce risk and are only to be used after risk assessment. Consider the following before executing the lift: • Personnel being struck by a dropped object when retrieving a tag line that is in close proximity to the load • Tag line becoming tangled around the body, limb, and/or hand of personnel • Tag line becoming snagged on an adjacent fixed structure • Length of tag Line • How tag lines will be recovered without going under suspended load • The proximity of personnel to the load A.3 Wind conditions The Construction Plant-hire Association, together with the UK Health and Safety Executive, has produced Technical Information Note 020, The Effect of Wind on Tower Cranes in Service. Readers are recommended to consult this document in full, available here: https://www.cpa.uk.net/tower-crane-interest-group-tcig-publications/. Summary of key points from TIN 0205: • Strong winds may swing suspended loads out of balance and radius, making a mobile crane unstable: – For large light loads, such as formwork panels/shutters, a mobile crane may become unstable at wind speeds some way below the crane’s design limiting wind speed 5 Construction Plant-hire Association and UK Health and Safety Executive. “Tower Crane Technical Information Note 020: The Effect of Wind on Tower Cranes In Service”. 2014. 34 Lifting and hoisting recommended practice – Where low density loads with a large area in relation to their mass are being lifted the maximum in-service wind speed must be reduced in accordance with the crane manufacturer’s instructions. • Operators should not lift a load if they do not feel that they can maintain full control of it. – An operator’s decision to take a crane out of service should not be overridden by management under any circumstances • Operators should monitor the wind speed constantly, using the anemometer display in the cab, if fitted. – Operators should take the mobile crane out of service before the limiting wind speed is reached. – Putting the crane in the out of service condition should be carried out by following the procedure set out in the manufacturer’s instructions manual. – Note: For offshore cranes, lifting operations should strictly follow the offshore Manual of Permitted Operating (MOPO) wind speed limit for the respective facility/platform. • During the planning of all lifts, take into consideration the anticipated wind speeds from site-specific weather forecasts. • Lifts should not be started in rising winds. – Most weather forecast wind speeds are for a height of 10m above ground and should be corrected for greater heights. – In open countryside, wind speed increases with height as shown in the table below: Height above 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 130 140 ground (meters) Wind speed 1.00 1.10 1.17 1.22 1.26 1.29 1.32 1.35 1.37 1.39 1.41 1.43 1.44 1.46 1.47 multiplier – In city centre locations, nearby buildings can have a very significant influence on wind forces, often providing shelter if at the same height as the crane, however local wind loads can be increased in some situations. Where surrounding buildings are significantly taller they will often generate increased wind loading on nearby lower cranes. These points, together with site-specific factors, should be considered when carrying out a risk assessment as part of the lift planning process. There are formulas to calculate the allowable wind speed for a specific lift as per standard practice and manufacturer’s instructions. An engineer should be contacted for this calculation. 35 Lifting and hoisting recommended practice A.4 Overhead powerlines During the planning of any lift, it is important to determine if any part of the equipment, load line, or load (including rigging and lifting accessories) could get close to a power line. If so, consider the following options: • Option 1: De-energize and ground. Confirm from the utility owner/operator that the power line has been deenergised and visibly grounded at the worksite. • Option 2: Ensure sufficient clearance in consultation with the utility owner/operator and in compliance with regional regulations • Option 3: Use Table B4 to determine if any part of the equipment, load line or load (including rigging and lifting accessories), while operating up to the equipment’s maximum working radius in the work zone, could get closer than the minimum approach distance of the power line. If tag lines are used, they must be non- conductive. This table is provided for guidance only; please confirm clearance distances with local legislation to ensure compliance. Table A1: Minimum clearance distances6 Voltage (nominal, kV, alternating current) Minimum clearance distance (meters) up to 50 over 50 to 200 4.5 over 200 to 350 over 350 to 500 7.5 over 500 to 750 10.5 over 750 to 1,000 13.5 (As established by the utility owner/operator or registered over 1,000 professional engineer who is a qualified person with respect to electrical power transmission and distribution). Note: The value that follows “to” is up to and includes that value. For example, over 50 to 200 means up to and including 200kV.
