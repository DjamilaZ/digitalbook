restricted from entering the Red Zone1, and all personnel are
kept clear of suspended/travelling loads and lifting equipment
or between the load and any heavy immovable object.

7 |  |  | Lifting Equipment is thoroughly examined on a regular basis
by an inspector who is sufficiently independent2 from the

appointee. The examination refers to an acknowledged
Standard for scope, methodology and acceptance/rejection
criteria. All safety and monitoring devices installed on lifting

nature and robustness of use and application as well as the
environments of use.

are recorded in an equipment register.

Approved Competent Person.
Principle

for lifting personnel is certified for the specific activity and
used according to recognised international standards.
