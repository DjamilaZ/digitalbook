I HAVE CONFIRMED: |  |  |  |  |  | 
1 The lift has been planned
2 T an h d e c h o a n z t a r r o d l s le a d re identified |  | • The lift method, equipment, and number of people required has been assessed and determined
• When required, an approved lift plan or procedure is in place and has been evaluated by a competent person
• The lift has been assessed for:
- load weight
- load size
- center of gravity (e.g., lifting points)
• The lifting equipment’s current capacity and condition has been assessed
• Equipment operator and lifting crew have discussed the written lift plan prior to lifting
• Complete a task risk assessment specific to the scope of work
• Discuss hazards with the work team prior to the start of work
• Identify overhead hazards and/or other obstructions (e.g., overhead power lines), making sure to check:
- load path |  |  |  | 
 |  | - swing radius
- overhead hazards
- pickup/lay-down zones
• Check for simultaneous operations that may introduce any additional hazards
• Discuss stop work considerations if work situation changes including change of weather
Note: Consider how to apply “hands-free lifting” (e.g., use of push poles and/or taglines) |  |  |  |

their task |  | • Lifting equipment operator and lifting crew are qualified to perform their task
Note: To be “qualified” may require certification and/or assessment to meet company or applicable legal
requirements |  |  |  | 
4 T st h a e b l le if t a in n g d e p q o u te ip n m tia e l n f t o i r s
unplanned movement has
been assessed |  | • Lifting appliance is level and/or placed on stable ground
• Matting has been assessed for stability and is level for the lifting equipment
• Outriggers are deployed
• Loads have been assessed for stability, taking into account:
- load securing
- workplace conditions
- travel path
- equipment capacity
• Equipment is operated per OEM requirements (e.g., weather, sea state and temperature) |  |  |  | 
5 T eq h u e i l p i m fti e n n g t a i n s: d r igging
• certified
• inspected
• rated for the lift |  | • Pre-use crane inspection has been completed
• Safety and monitoring devices are in place and functioning
• Manufacturer’s load chart is available
• The rigging equipment has been inspected prior to lift
• The rigging equipment is rated for the lift
Note: If load chart does not exist, assume equipment is not rated for the lift; stop work and identify
alternative lifting equipment that is rated for the load |  |  |  | 
6 A an c d o m re m sp u o n n i s c i a b t i i l o it n i e p s l a a n r e
agreed to by the lift crew |  | • Communication method(s) (e.g., hand signals, radio) have been agreed to and tested
• Equipment operator and lifting crew have discussed the emergency response, including what emergency
stop signals be used
• The person in charge of the lift has been identified as per the lift plan or procedure
• The members of the lift crew have agreed to their individual roles and responsibilities for the lift
• The signaler for the lift has been identified (banksman/flagman/dogman/spotter) |  |  |  | 
7 T in h s e p e lo c a te d d h p a r s i o b r e e to n lift |  | • Every load has been inspected for integrity and stability (e.g., center of gravity)
- The load and its packaging can withstand the forces/motion caused by the lift
• Loose objects have been secured or removed prior to lift
• Loose and small objects are well packaged or placed in lifting basket |  |  |  | 
8 B zo a n r e ri s e a rs re a i n n d p e l x a c c l e usion |  | • Exclusion zones have been identified and controls are in place to protect people from line of fire hazards, including:
- working under suspended loads
- moving objects
- dropped objects
• Access to exclusion zones is controlled (e.g., attendant or physical barriers)
• Escape routes are unobstructed and known by the work crew |  |  |  | 
Confirm these controls/safeguards are in place and verified prior to starting work.
Stop and seek help if anything changes. |  |  |  |  |  |
