 |  | Lifting Equipment is thoroughly examined on a regular basis  by an inspector who is sufficiently independent2 from the  on-site lifting crew, and who may be external or an in-house  appointee. The examination refers to an acknowledged  Standard for scope, methodology and acceptance/rejection  criteria. All safety and monitoring devices installed on lifting  equipment are operational and not by-passed or disabled.  NOTE: Periods of inspections can be influenced by the   nature and robustness of use and application as well as the  environments of use. | 
 |  | All lifting equipment is visually inspected by a competent  person before and after use. Equipment integrity is  maintained and faulty equipment is removed from serviced  and tagged as such. Inspection and maintenance activities  are recorded in an equipment register. | 
 |  | Periodic audits and inspections are conducted by an   Approved Competent Person. | 
 |  | Any Lifting of personnel is classified to the category requiring  the highest level of controls (IOGP Category 3) and a rescue  plan is included as part of the Lift Plan. Any equipment used  for lifting personnel is certified for the specific activity and  used according to recognised international standards. |
