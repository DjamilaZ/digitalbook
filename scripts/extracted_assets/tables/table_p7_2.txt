Confirm each control/ safeguard below before  starting work Guidance for confirming each control/safeguard | Guidance for confirming each control/safeguard |  |  | Person(s)  Performing  Work | Start-Work  Verifier | 
I HAVE CONFIRMED: |  |  |  |  |  | 
1 The lift has been planned 2 The hazards are identified  and controlled • The lift method, equipment, and number of people required has been assessed and determined • When required, an approved lift plan or procedure is in place and has been evaluated by a competent person • The lift has been assessed for: • The lifting equipment’s current capacity and condition has been assessed • Equipment operator and lifting crew have discussed the written lift plan prior to lifting • Complete a task risk assessment specific to the scope of work • Discuss hazards with the work team prior to the start of work • Identify overhead hazards and/or other obstructions (e.g., overhead power lines), making sure to check: | • The lift method, equipment, and number of people required has been assessed and determined • When required, an approved lift plan or procedure is in place and has been evaluated by a competent person • The lift has been assessed for:  - load weight  - load size  - center of gravity (e.g., lifting points)  • The lifting equipment’s current capacity and condition has been assessed • Equipment operator and lifting crew have discussed the written lift plan prior to lifting • Complete a task risk assessment specific to the scope of work • Discuss hazards with the work team prior to the start of work • Identify overhead hazards and/or other obstructions (e.g., overhead power lines), making sure to check:   - load path |  |  |  |  | 
• Check for simultaneous operations that may introduce any additional hazards • Discuss stop work considerations if work situation changes including change of weather Note | - load path   - swing radius  - overhead hazards  - pickup/lay-down zones • Check for simultaneous operations that may introduce any additional hazards • Discuss stop work considerations if work situation changes including change of weather Note : Consider how to apply “hands-free lifting” (e.g., use of push poles and/or taglines) |  |  |  |  | 
3 Workers involved with the  lift are qualified to perform  their task • Lifting equipment operator and lifting crew are qualified to perform their task  Note requirements | • Lifting equipment operator and lifting crew are qualified to perform their task  Note : To be “qualified” may require certification and/or assessment to meet company or applicable legal  requirements |  |  |  |  | 
4 The lifting equipment is  stable and potential for  unplanned movement has  been assessed • Lifting appliance is level and/or placed on stable ground • Matting has been assessed for stability and is level for the lifting equipment • Outriggers are deployed • Loads have been assessed for stability, taking into account:  • Equipment is operated per OEM requirements (e.g., weather, sea state and temperature) | • Lifting appliance is level and/or placed on stable ground • Matting has been assessed for stability and is level for the lifting equipment • Outriggers are deployed • Loads have been assessed for stability, taking into account:   - load securing  - workplace conditions  - travel path  - equipment capacity • Equipment is operated per OEM requirements (e.g., weather, sea state and temperature) |  |  |  |  | 
5 The lifting and rigging  equipment is:     • certified  • inspected  • rated for the lift • Pre-use crane inspection has been completed • Safety and monitoring devices are in place and functioning • Manufacturer’s load chart is available • The rigging equipment has been inspected prior to lift  • The rigging equipment is rated for the lift Note alternative lifting equipment that is rated for the load | • Pre-use crane inspection has been completed • Safety and monitoring devices are in place and functioning • Manufacturer’s load chart is available • The rigging equipment has been inspected prior to lift  • The rigging equipment is rated for the lift Note : If load chart does not exist, assume equipment is not rated for the lift;  stop  work and identify  alternative lifting equipment that is rated for the load |  |  |  |  | 
6 A communication plan  and responsibilities  are  agreed to by the lift crew • Communication method(s) (e.g., hand signals, radio) have been agreed to and tested • Equipment operator and lifting crew have discussed the emergency response, including what emergency  • The person in charge of the lift has been identified as per the lift plan or procedure • The members of the lift crew have agreed to their individual roles and responsibilities for the lift • The signaler for the lift has been identified (banksman/flagman/dogman/spotter) | • Communication method(s) (e.g., hand signals, radio) have been agreed to and tested • Equipment operator and lifting crew have discussed the emergency response, including what emergency  stop signals be used • The person in charge of the lift has been identified as per the lift plan or procedure • The members of the lift crew have agreed to their individual roles and responsibilities for the lift • The signaler for the lift has been identified (banksman/flagman/dogman/spotter) |  |  |  |  | 
7 The load has been  inspected prior to lift • Every load has been inspected for integrity and stability (e.g., center of gravity) • Loose objects have been secured or removed prior to lift • Loose and small objects are well packaged or placed in lifting basket | • Every load has been inspected for integrity and stability (e.g., center of gravity)  - The load and its packaging can withstand the forces/motion caused by the lift • Loose objects have been secured or removed prior to lift • Loose and small objects are well packaged or placed in lifting basket |  |  |  |  | 
8 Barriers and exclusion  zones are in place • Exclusion zones have been identified and controls are in place to protect people from line of fire hazards, including: • Access to exclusion zones is controlled (e.g., attendant or physical barriers) • Escape routes are unobstructed and known by the work crew | • Exclusion zones have been identified and controls are in place to protect people from line of fire hazards, including:  - working under suspended loads  - moving objects   - dropped objects • Access to exclusion zones is controlled (e.g., attendant or physical barriers) • Escape routes are unobstructed and known by the work crew |  |  |  |  | 
Confirm these controls/safeguards are in place and verified prior to starting work. Stop and seek help if anything changes. |  |  |  |  |  |
