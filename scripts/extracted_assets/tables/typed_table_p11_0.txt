During the lift, will the crane operator’s visibility of the load be restricted/limited (i.e., ‘blind lift’)? |  | 
Is the load to be rotated, up-ended/up-righted (roll-up, tailing or special lifting operations) or transferred from
one appliance to another during operation? |  | 
Will the lift be subsea? |  | 
Will the lift involve proof load testing of appliances or lifting equipment? |  | 
If you’ve answered YES to ANY of the above, the lift is CATEGORY 3.
If you’ve answered NO to ALL of the above, check the next set of questions |  | 
CATEGORY 2 | Y | N
Is the gross load weight over 80% of the certified load radius curve of a mobile crane? |  | 
Is the lift outside normal operating conditions for the equipment or the asset? |  | 
Is the weight distribution uneven, or does it have the potential to shift? |  | 
Will environmental conditions place restrictions on lifting operations? |  | 
Is the load of an unusual shape? |  | 
Is the weight of the load estimated (i.e., not known)? |  | 
Does the load have any hazards such as sharp edges? |  | 
Is the load subject to permanent deformation? |  | 
Absence of designed and tested lifting points? |  | 
Does the load have excessive dimension (limited clearance from crane structures, surroundings)? |  | 
Is the operation taking place during SIMOPS or interfering with other concurrent activities? |  | 
If you’ve answered YES to any of the above, the Lift is CATEGORY 2.
If you’ve answered NO to ALL of the above, the lift is likely Category 1. |  | 
CATEGORY 1 | Y | N
Are all these three conditions present? |  | 
1. You have you answered “No” to all questions in Category 3 and Category 2 |  | 
AND |  | 
2. The personnel involved in the lift are trained, assessed as competent and authorised to perform their
specific role |  | 
AND |  | 
3. The lifting equipment and the load are simple to use and lift |  | 
Only if ALL the 3 conditions for Category 1 are present, is the lift classified as CATEGORY 1. |  |
